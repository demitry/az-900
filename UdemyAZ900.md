- Describe Azure management and governance (30–35%)

## Section 2: AZ-900 - Describe Cloud Computing

### What is Cloud Computing? [6]

Create Resource
- VM
- Web app - abstraction above the VM
- Function App - code for small pieces of code
- Logic App
  - connect 2 apps together
  - event triggers - do something else
  - chain things together, boxes and lines

Categories
- AI + ML
- Translator
- QnA Maker..Wow!
- ... Wow!

Type "Marketplace" => additional!!! but not supported by MS

### Shared Responsibility Model [7]

How MS and you have divided responsibility for security etc.

- On premises - you - All responsibility 
- Cloud VM Responsibility
 - MS Azure takes responsibility: 
    - Building security
    - Physical network
    - Physical computer security
- Cloud AppService Responsibility
    - Building security
    - Physical network
    - Physical computer security
    - + OS patches
    - + Shared Responsibility for Network and Firewall settings, App Settings, Auth Platform
- Cloud SaaS responsibility
    - Building security
    - Physical network
    - Physical computer security
    - OS patches
    - Cloud Resp: Network and Firewall settings, App Settings, 
    - Mixed resp: Auth Platform

### Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud [8]

#### Summary

- *private* = your resources, your control, flexibility, sca;ability
- *public* = cloud provider (Azure) resources, Lower costs, no maintenance, scalability—on-demand, High reliability
- *hybrid* - mixed

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-are-private-public-hybrid-clouds/

#### public
The cloud resources (like servers and storage) are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the internet. With a public cloud, all hardware, software, and other supporting infrastructure are owned and managed by the cloud provider. Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud.

- Lower costs—no need to purchase hardware or software, and you pay only for the service you use.
- No maintenance—your service provider provides the maintenance.
- Near-unlimited scalability—on-demand resources are available to meet your business needs.
- High reliability—a vast network of servers ensures against failure.

#### private
cloud computing resources used exclusively by one business or organization. The private cloud can be physically located at your organization’s on-site datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider. But in a private cloud, the services and infrastructure are always maintained on a private network and the hardware and software are dedicated solely to your organization.

- More flexibility — your organization can customize its cloud environment to meet specific business needs.
- More control — resources are not shared with others, so higher levels of control and privacy are possible.
- More scalability — private clouds often offer more scalability compared to on-premises infrastructure.

#### hybrid
combines on-premises infrastructure—or a private cloud—with a public cloud. Hybrid clouds allow data and apps to move between the two environments.

### Cloud Pricing [9]

predict, min-max, predictability...

Factors Affecting VM Pricing:
- Geo Location
- VM, Disk, Size, 
- Bandwidth, Performance
- Backup Storage
- Support Agreement
- OS SKU / License
- Reservation Saving Plan

Factors Affecting Cosmos DB Pricing:
- API Choice
- Standard Model / Serverless
- Consumed Storage
- Backup Storage
- Region / Regions
- Number of Operations per Second
- Optional Dedicated Gateway

100 options...

MS: 55+ free tier services

Some have limits

Pay for time
- Charge by time used
- Stop using service - stop the charges

Pay for GB
- 0,02 per GB per month
- pay for traffic inbound / outbound  from / to regions or to the internet

Pay for Operations
- charge per operation
- Ops: read, write, list, delete
- Pay per message
- Pay per query to the DB
- Cheap Penny/10000

###   Quiz 1: ## Section 2 Quiz

Question 1:
What are the responsibilities of the customers according to the shared responsibility model?
- Patching guest OS and applications!

(no: fix infrastructure, no physical and env control, no config infrastructure Azure devices)

Question 2:
In which cloud service model can an organization offload its entire physical hardware responsibilities, potentially allowing it to shut down its on-premises data center?

- public cloud 

An organisation can close its DC by hosting its infrastructure in a public cloud. The public cloud is defined as computing services offered by third-party providers over the public Internet, making them available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. The private cloud is defined as computing services offered either over the Internet or a private internal network and only to select users instead of the general public. A private cloud can be deployed on-premise or in a third-party hosted environment. A hybrid cloud combines the use of both public and private clouds.

Question 3:
A company has distributed its workload on both the Azure Cloud and some on-premises servers. What type of architecture is this?

- hybrid cloud

Good job!
A hybrid cloud is a type of cloud computing that combines on-premises infrastructure—or a private cloud—with a public cloud.

## Section 3: AZ-900 - Benefits of Cloud Computing
### High Availability  - Benefit of Cloud Computing [11]

High Availability - ability of the system to remain operational during *planned or unplanned outages*.

High Availability - is predetermined designed effort to avoid sources of downtime in planned and unplanned outages.

#### Planned Outages
- Security Patches
- Application Updates
- Hardware replacement
- Migrating to a new hosting provider

#### Unplanned Outages
- Hardware failure
- Network disruptions
- Power outages
- Natural disasters (hurricane, earthquakes)
- Cyber attacks (Human disasters)
- Software bugs
- Poor Scaling / architecture design (bootle necks)

#### Methods to Mitigate Planned Outages
- Gradual deployment strategy
  - Facebook don't deploy 100 services at once, 1, 10
  - 1-10-100-etc.
- Testing and monitoring of deployment
- Easy rollback plan
  - Azure Deployment slots
- Frequent Deployment
  - Less features - less deployment
- Automation of deployment
- DevOps mentality

#### Methods to Mitigate Unplanned Outages
- Every single core component has redundancy
  - Higher cost, but handle outage
- Azure for availability
  - Availability Sets
  - Availability Zones
  - Cross-Region Load Balancing / Front Door
- Constant real-time Health monitoring / probes
- Automation
- String security practices
- Be geographically distributed
- Have a disaster recovery plan
- Test that disaster recovery plan!
  - fire drills (противопожарные учения)!
- Need to recover quickly
- Min downtime
- Load testing - scaling, autoscaling
  - How many users can you handle
