What is cloud computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. Cloud services also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI).

Because cloud computing uses the internet to deliver these services, it doesn’t have to be constrained by physical infrastructure the same way that a traditional datacenter is. That means if you need to increase your IT infrastructure rapidly, you don’t have to wait to build a new datacenter—you can use the cloud to rapidly expand your IT footprint.

Compute Power - how much processing you can do
Storage - can request more + Back-Ups

1. Which cloud service type is most suited to a lift and shift migration from an on-premises datacenter to a cloud deployment? 
- IaaS
With an IaaS service type, you can approximate your on-premises environment, making a **lift-and-shift transition** to the cloud relatively straightforward.


2. What type of cloud service type would a Finance and Expense tracking solution typically be in?
